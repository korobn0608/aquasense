We utilize the Arduino IDE to load the C++ firmware onto the board, establishing a connection between the ESP32 in Arduino R4 and the Control Computer via WIFI. The Arduino R4 receives accurate data from four sensors,  which undergo calibration using an average algorithm before transmission to the server.
